You are in a small opening that looks like a room.
You see a coffin on the ground.
The coffin looks like it has been untouched for a very long time.
It is covered with dust and cobwebs.
What was that noise?
Is something inside the coffin?

How do you leave the room to go back where you came from?

Hint: $ cd ..
