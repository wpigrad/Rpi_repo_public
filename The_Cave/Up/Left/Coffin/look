As you slide the heavy stone covering the coffin, a strong wind blows and 
you hear a sinister voice say "Thank you".

You look in the coffin.
There is a skeleton dressed in armor.

You notice a small pouch on the skeleton's belt.

How do you leave the coffin and get back to the room?
Hint: $ cd ..
